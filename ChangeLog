2005-09-13 00:55  anderson

	* util/: action.c, main.c, outputtxt.c: Try to make the output
	  easier to read. Leave out some details unless -v (verbose) is

	  making exposure of fileOutputMethod function useless

2005-09-01 01:01  anderson

	* util/: action.c, action.h, decompile.c, decompile.h: New
	  decompiler that goes with the new parser. This handles Flash 7.
	  This decompiler is passed an entire block of actions which were
	  collected by the parser code. This allows the decompiler to look
	  forward and backward a few actions to help make it's decisions.

	  This is not yet complete, but is working well enough for people
	  to look at and comment on. There are still a few things in the
	  old code to be reapplied to this new code.

2005-08-31 11:37  anderson

	* util/outputtxt.c: When built for listaction, include actions in
	  some less obvious places

	  handled.  outputtxt.c: fill in missing StraightEdge detail, pass
	  action number to	     outputSWF_ACTION() parser.c: Change
	  how parseSWF_ACTIONRECORD() is called. It now has access
	  to the entire block of action record,s not just a single record.
		Implement IF parsing which puts the conditional block of
	  action	 in a seperate block hanging off of this record.
	  swftypes.h: Add the Offset to all records types.

2005-06-10 00:36  anderson

	* CREDITS, ChangeLog: Added strk and Stuart

2005-05-30 23:40  anderson

	* util/swftypes.h: Fix how we define SWF_ACTION record within
	actions. This was why some records were getting steeped on becasue
	the arrays elements were using the wrong size of type

2005-05-30 23:22  anderson

	* util/: decompile.c, decompile.h, outputscript.c, outputtxt.c,
	parser.c, swftypes.h: Break decompiles a bit less now:
	
	1) Restore the indent parameter in calls to decompile5Action().
	It's removal	indavertantly left gIndent uninitialized which
	caused the code to loop    for a very very long time.  2) The
	SWFACTION_WIHT blocks weren't being parsed right. The SWF Spec	 
	seems to describes the block incorrectly.

2005-05-30 20:24  anderson

	* util/: parser.c, swftypes.h: Parse more Block types

2005-05-30 14:48  anderson

	* util/: decompile.c, decompile.h, outputdecl.h, outputscript.c,
	outputtxt.c, parser.c, parserdecl.h, swftypes.h: 1) define
	structures for all action through v7 2) Rename some actions to
	better match SWF File Format Specification 3) Parse all actions and
	build data structures instead of just calling decompile() 4) Change
	the decompiler to work off of the new data structures instead of   
	the file stream. There is much more work needed here to restore the
	full	functionallity of decompile.  5) Fill in the implmentation
	for several mroe block types

2005-05-30 14:42  anderson

	* util/main.c: Make an error fatal for now to make it more obvious

	peekBytes() which is similar to dumpBytes, but it rewinds the file
	offset.

	* src/blocks/Makefile: 
	
	first attempt at adding existing SWF files to ming generated
	movies: this will open a movie, add its exports, if any to the main
	movie, and convert the movie inta a placable clip Pitfalls: loading
	a swf file into a mc generates a new namespace, while this method
	does not - it is possible that two swf files contribute the same
	exports.  fonts are (not yet) merged, so if existing swf movies add
	the same font, there will be duplicate storage.  Further, if the
	same font appears twice and is used within a html-enabled
	textfield, chances are that the wrong set of characters will be

	src/blocks/text.c, src/blocks/text.h, src/blocks/textfield.c,
	src/blocks/textfield.h: 
	changed: - use addString() and getWidth() for codepage text again
	use addUTF8String() and getUTF8Width() for unicode text
	
	- modified the drawshape function to handle some existing fonts
	that specify 1 bit (rather than 0 bits) for the number of line
	styles
	
	added: - endMask() for mask operations use:	$mask_instance =
	$movie->add($shape); // mask shape     // add more characters on
	top of the mask       $mask_instance->endMask();
	
	- font embedding for text fields use:	$tf = new SWFTextField(....
	| SWFTEXTFIELD_USEFONT);    $tf->setFont($font);   
	$tf->addChars("0123456789"); will create a text field that uses
	font embedding only for numbers.  Note a) adding chars actually
	adds to a font instance rather than the text field, so if one text
	field is set up for digits and the other for alphabet, both will
	have all alphanumerics available Note b) with html text fields, it
	is possible to mix fonts. With FP5, both browser and embedded fonts
	could be mixed. FP6 now requires all fonts to be embedded
	
	- Ming_useConstants(flag) function to disable the use of constant
	pool in actionscripts ... would make sense to disable if you create
	100 buttons with simple script
	
	- added a few existing functions to the php and perl interfaces:   
	    $textfield->setPadding()	    $movie->addExport()    
	$movie->writeExports()
	
	- new function $font->getShape(code) returns the character shape as
	a multiline text. It is meant to be split into lines, where every
	line represents a line or curve segment. For a possible use see
	http://www.neuralust.com/~mingdocs/code/knifeexample.swf

	SWFDisplayItem_setMaskLevel() - in SWFDisplayItem_setDepth(),
	either I set the depth in the PlaceObject   thing, or there is
	really no point of having this function (unless I am   missing
	something).

2001-07-26 01:55  raff

	* src/blocks/swf.h: added prototype for
	SWFPlaceObject2Block_setMaskLevel()

2001-07-26 01:49  raff

	* src/blocks/: placeobject.c, placeobject.h: - the masklevel (clip
	depth) comes before the object name, not after - exported
	SWFPlaceObject2Block_setMaskLevel - I really need to be able to
	change the depth level	 (SWFPlaceObject2Block_setDepth) before
	emitting the object, in order to   properly use the masklevel.

2001-07-25 02:33  raff

	* src/actioncompiler/: swf4compiler.flex, swf4compiler.y: This
	fixes a bunch of problems with parsing a "sprite path" in the Flash
	4 compiler (I don't know how the Flash 5 compiler works, but since
	this part of the code is completely different it may be ok).
	
	Now you can do things like /root/movie/submovie:variable, ./movie,
	/movie/../anothermovie, etc. (I used to have problems with more
	than one submovie)
	
	(note: I am not simplifying ANY path - i.e. the ones containing ..
	- they get sent straight to the Flash player. But it seems to work,
	so... :)

2001-07-25 02:29  raff

	* src/actioncompiler/Makefile: - 'make clean' now also removes the
	files generated by flex and bison.  - added a FLEXDEBUG option, in
	case I really need to see what's going on.

2001-07-25 02:25  raff

	* src/actioncompiler/main.c: I still am faithfull to the Flash 4
	compiler, so here is a --4 option to select it (the default, as
	before, is to use the new compiler).

2001-07-24 02:06  opaque_ndst

	* src/libming.h: commented out garbage after #endif

2001-07-18 03:05  raff

	* src/actioncompiler/: swf4compiler.flex, swf5compiler.flex: added
	escape sequences \b, \f, \n, \r, \t and a warning message for \x
	and \u (every other character that follows a '\' is left unchanged
	but of course the '\' is removed).

2001-07-18 02:37  raff

	* src/actioncompiler/: swf4compiler.flex, swf5compiler.flex:
	Strings can contain escaped characters ( mainly the escape
	character itself '\' and quotes, so I guess removing the escape
	character is the right thing to do - and I am too lazy to find a
	way to do it in Flex :)
	
	One day we can support escape sequences ( \b, \f, \n, \r, \t ) and
	hex/unicode values ( \xHH, \uHHHH ) by "fixing" the unescape
	function.

2001-06-14 11:11  raff

	* util/decompile.c: a bunch of fixes to make the ActionScript look
	more like ActionScript :)
	
	- calling multiple pop() as parameters to a function is very bad,  
	because the C standard doesn't guarantee that they'll be called  
	in the order you expect. Most of the compilers push parameters	
	left to right, but gcc on Mac OSX has to be special!
	
	  In most of the places the pop() calls were already outside the
	  function calls, but a few of them didn't make it.
	
	- SETPROPERTY wasn't correctly expanding the property name, as
	GETPROPERTY   did
	
	- fixed a few things with strings
	
	- unknown opcodes stop the decompilation process, but ACTION_POP is
	a   known opcode (don't know when Flash generates it, but it
	does!).    Still there are some cases where the decompilare get
	lost, mostly	after a POP, but I am not sure of what to do!

2001-06-14 11:02  raff

	* src/actioncompiler/: compiler.y, oldcompiler.y: This fixes a

	In this case the conditional expression is NULL (since there isn't
	one).
	
	So, the code checks if the conditional expression is null and in
	that case creates a new buffer and SKIP the code that generates the
	conditional branch.

	wide-character fonts, but maybe we don't want to abort the program
	run, since there may be other fonts we want to extract.
